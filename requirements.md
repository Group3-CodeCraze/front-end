## data flow

User Interaction:
The user interacts with the user interface of the to-do list app, including creating tasks, updating task details, marking tasks as complete.
The user may also interact with settings or preferences related to the app.

Client-side Processing:
The user's actions and input are processed on the client-side using JavaScript and React.

API Communication:
The client-side sends requests to the server-side API to perform operations such as creating tasks, updating task details, retrieving task lists, etc.
These requests are typically made using HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

Server-side Processing:
The server receives the API requests from the client-side and processes them.

Database Interaction:
The server interacts with the database ( PSQL) to store and retrieve task data.
Database operations include inserting new tasks, updating existing tasks, fetching task lists.

Response Generation:
The server generates appropriate responses based on the API request and database interactions.
Responses may include success messages, error messages, updated task lists, or other relevant data.

Client-side Update:
The client-side receives the API response and updates the user interface accordingly.
This may include displaying success or error messages, updating task lists, refreshing data.
